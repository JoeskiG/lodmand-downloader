Not a BeamNG.drive Modland Downloader

![downloader](https://github.com/JoeskiG/lodmand-downloader/assets/115059273/65d7c3d5-504f-4601-b610-405437f48c18 | width="200")


### What is it?
It is a simple mod downloader for a popular third party BeamNG.drive mods website.
You can download mod files in 2 clicks, directly to your game's mods folder.

### Will there be any more updates?
If I feel like it I guess...



# How to use the software
### 1. Download it
Go to this link to download: ![url](https://github.com/JoeskiG/lodmand-downloader/releases/latest/joeski_mod_downloader.exe)
Then, open it.

### 2. Set up game mods folder
Once you have opened the application, if you have not used it before, you will be greeted with a setup screen.
Here, click Select Mods Folder and browse to your game's mods folder and click OK in the file explorer dialog.
Then, the Complete Setup button should become green. Click this. Now you can start looking for mods!

### 3. Find a mod
You can use the search bar, or the page selector at the top right to find mods. Once you have found a mod you want to download, click the Download button on the mod.
After loading, it should show a list of files that the mod has available for download.

### 4. Download the file
Now, all you have to do is click Download on the file of the mod you want to download and it should start downloading. Once finished, the download button should turn green. The mod should then appear in the mods folder you set before.

It is possible for the mod download to fail. If this is the case, try closing the app and opening it again and downloading again. If that doesn't work, contact me on Discord: localhost#3302



### Issues
Don't change the page or use the search feature while a mod is downloading. 
If you cancel a download, the file still remains, so your game will likely give an Invalid ZIP error because it is not complete. Do the download again and it should overwrite that file, or delete it if you don't want that mod.
